# Python-codes
This project combines a fireworks display with music in Python using Pygame. It features colorful animations triggered by mouse clicks and plays background music. Users can easily add their own music files. I aimed to enhance my coding skills while creating a visually engaging experience. This marks my first step into the world of game development!
